=======

A centralized web application developed for the **Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT)** to prepare, manage, approve, and consolidate **Project Procurement Management Plans (PPMP)** and compile **Annual Procurement Plans (APP)** in compliance with Philippine procurement laws (**Republic Act No. 12009 — New Government Procurement Act**).

---

## 📋 Features & Capabilities

### 1. PPMP Management & 3-Step Wizard
- **3-Step Guided Form**: Form wizard validating *Project Details*, *Timeline Sequence*, and *Funding & Supporting Documents*.
- **Multi-Item Grouping**: Multiple line items grouped under one official PPMP number per office.
- **Reference Number Engine**: Auto-generates standardized reference numbers per category (`<Year>-GDS-####`, `<Year>-INF-####`, `<Year>-CSV-####`, `<Year>-GEN-####`).
- **Multi-Item Navigator**: Browse, view, and update line items within a saved PPMP without leaving the modal.

### 2. Philippine Procurement Rules (RA 12009 Compliance)
- **Automated Two Failed Biddings Detection (Sec. 33)**: 
  - Cross-references project descriptions across approved PPMP records for the requesting office.
  - Automatically locks the 3rd attempt to **Negotiated Procurement – Two Failed Biddings** with **Negotiated** evaluation criteria.
  - Automatically prepends and tags previous attempts with `[1st Failure]` and `[2nd Failure]`.
- **Budget Threshold & Bracket Enforcement**:
  - **Direct Acquisition (Sec. 32)**: Up to ₱200,000.00 for NGAs.
  - **Small Value Procurement (SVP) (Sec. 31)**: ₱200,001.00 to ₱2,000,000.00.
  - **Shopping (Sec. 30)**: Up to ₱2,000,000.00 (restricted strictly to *Goods*).
  - **Competitive Bidding (Sec. 15)**: ₱2,000,000.00 and above (or any eligible amount).
- **Milestone Date Sequencing**: Strict chronological date validation (`Advertisement/Posting` -> `Bid Opening` -> `Notice of Award` -> `Contract Signing` -> `Delivery Period`).
- **Deduplicated Total Budget**: Multiple re-bidding attempts sharing the same reference number count only once toward the total budget.
- **Parallel Planning Lanes**: Requesting offices can maintain an active *Final* PPMP (current year) and an *Indicative* PPMP (next year) in parallel.
- **Fiscal Year Rollover**: When the APP of a fiscal year is finalized and marked Complete by the Regional Director, the year is automatically closed against new requests, and subsequent requests default to the next open year.

### 3. Multi-Stage Approval Workflows
- **PPMP Chain**: `Requesting Unit / Unit Head` -> `TOD (Technical Operations Division)` -> `Budget Officer` -> `RD (Regional Director)`.
  - *Unit Head Submissions*: Automatically bypass the HEAD stage and endorse directly to TOD with an automated remark log.
- **APP Master Workflow**:
  - Compiled and monitored by the **Supply Account (`SUP`)**.
  - Endorsed by the **Assistant Regional Director (`ARD`)**.
  - Final approval and marking as Final by the **Regional Director (`RD`)**.
- **Audit Trails**: Full review history tracking approver role, date, decision (Approve / Reject / Remark), and mandatory returned remarks.

### 4. Native Storage & Large File Management
- **IndexedDB `FileStore`**: Stores up to 50MB of raw document blobs (PDFs, Scope of Work, Technical Specs) natively in the browser without filling `localStorage`.
- **System Persistence**: State persistence for dark/light themes, offline sessions, and sequential approval logs.

### 5. Document Generation & Export Engines
- **GPPB-Compliant PDF Generator**:
  - Official PPMP printout with multi-item layout and 3-column signature block.
  - Automated APP PDF assembly with automated category routing:
    - General Administration and Support Services (GASS) -> *Common Supplies and Equipment (CSE)*.
    - Direct Acquisition -> *Miscellaneous Items (Sec. 32.2)*.
    - All other items -> *General Requirements*.
- **ExcelJS Styled Spreadsheets**:
  - Single PPMP `.xlsx` download formatted to official government templates.
  - Master Entries export packaging all filtered PPMPs into dedicated sheets in one workbook.
  - Official DBM APP Template export (`.xlsx`) with embedded `=SUM()` and `=MOOE + CO` formulas.
- **Bulk Import**:
  - Excel template generator with drop-down data validation and instruction guides.
  - Multi-row template parser via SheetJS with row-by-row error diagnostics.
